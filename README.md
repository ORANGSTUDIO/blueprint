# Blueprint

## Introduction

Blueprint is generally called visual programming or blueprint programming, which was first proposed by Unreal Engine in UE4 to create games and interactive applications. It allows developers to use a graphical interface to create code delivery without writing traditional code. Blueprints can be used to create various elements such as angles, AI, levels, special effects, animations, etc. in the game, and can also be used to create user interfaces, general editing processes, etc. in interactive applications.

Blueprints use nodes and wires to represent code delivery, node code blocks, and wire code execution sequences. Developers can create code editors by dragging and dropping nodes, setting parameters, connecting nodes, and more. Blueprint also provides many internal setting nodes and functions, such as mathematical calculation, bar judgment, loop, function call, etc., so that developers can create complex code releases more efficiently.

Early zero-code or low-code development generally achieved business process building through BPM. With the compounding of needs, the process engine based on the BPMN standard has been difficult to meet more and more business needs, and the low/zero-code platform has a stronger demand for Turing-complete business editor-in-chief. In this context, Zero Shoulder Group introduces the blueprint into the low-code application development platform, and arranges it with real-life business chief editors.
